1. This is the stack at each step;

STEP 1:
8,
STEP 2:
8, 2,
STEP 3:
pop() = 2
8,
STEP 4:
16,
STEP 5:
16, 10,
STEP 6:
16, 5,

3. To search a Deque in O(n/2) time we want to search from both ends at a time:

public int findIndex(Object T, Deque deque){
        for(int i = 0; i < deque.size(); i++){
            if(deque.pollFirst() == T){
                return i;
            }
            if(deque.pollLast() == T){
                return deque.size() - i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

This is code to do that.
